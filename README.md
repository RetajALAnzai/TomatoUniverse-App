## 🌟 Overview

Many people begin new habits or goals but struggle to maintain them over time.  
**Tomato Universe** transforms this challenge into an enjoyable journey using the **Pomodoro system**, which divides work into focused time intervals (Pomodoros) followed by short breaks.  
Through **Gamification**, **Documentation**, and **Journaling**, users can track their progress, visualize streaks, and stay motivated to achieve consistency.
